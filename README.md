# DPDataVis

A WIP collection of data visualization tools using D3.js and the D3 tooltip library (https://github.com/caged/d3-tip).

HTML scripts with D3 elements must be launched within a local server. Clone this repository, navigate to the DPDataVis repo, and ensure the npm package is installed (https://github.com/npm/npm). Then run the command "npm install -g http-server". After this, the server can be launched within the directory at any time by using "http-server -c-1".
